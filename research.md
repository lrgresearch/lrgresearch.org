 ![Produced MgZnO/ZnO samples for electr'cal measurements](files/mgzno-proje.png) |  With this project, ZnO-based heterostructures were reported for the first time with the USCVD method. In addition, the USCVD method was developed with a remote plasma system and the USPECVD system was installed. Within the scope of the project, MgZnO/ZnO heterostructures were grown with both USCVD and USPECVD methods. For this purpose, ZnO, MgZnO and doped MgZnO growths were performed on soda-lime, SiO2/Si and wurtzite substrates. The grown ZnO and MgZnO structures were examined in detail as a result of both structural and optical characterizations. According to many experimental parameters obtained, ZnO crystals were successfully produced in the form of thin films. MgZnO crystals were found to have a very different growth behavior than ZnO crystals. The 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) behavior was observed in low temperatures in the heterostructure. Based on the experience gained with this project, it has been concluded that MgZnO growth has very complex chemistry and this growth behavior should be examined much more deeply within the scope of a new scientific project. With this in-depth analysis of this growth method, more successful and usable MgZnO/ZnO structures can be produced and it can be competed with AlGaN/GaN.

 ![XRD results shows the effect of strain](files/ultrathin-proje.png) | In this project, ultra-thin barrier HEMTs will be designed for different configurations including polarization, voltage and temperature variations, with solving the high-performance self-consistent 1-dimensional Schr√∂dinger-Poisson equations. Band structure, carrier density, and strain distributions are calculated. After design and modelling, the best structures are grown with Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) method. After, the electrical properties (Hall), and structural properties (Atomic force microscopy, X-Ray Diffraction) of these grown structures are measured. Results are enlighthened us to better understand ultra-thin barrier HEMT structures and result to look forward for producing transistors without the short-channel effects. 

### Modification of properties of two-dimensional electronic gas using in situ surface passivation of AlGaN/GaN heterostructures by molecular beam epitaxy

*Joint grant of Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey and RFBR of Russia, TUBITAK 2532 Project*

 ![Samples for hot-electron measurements](files/rusya-proje.png) | In this project, the effect of in situ grown Si3N4  passivation on electrical, optical and structural properties of 2DEG including AlGaN/GaN structures were investigated in details. For the characterization, Hall effect, quantum Hall effect, high-speed pulse high electric field measurements, Raman, atomic force microscopy, x-ray diffraction and photoluminescence measurements were taken and analyzed. In addition to these experimental methods, the effect of several impurities on electronic and optical properties of Si3N4  material was investigated with density functional theory. In addition, some transistor parameters of high power transistors with Si3N4 passivation with impurities were calculated with device simulations.
