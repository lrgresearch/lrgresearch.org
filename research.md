 ![Samples for hot=electron measurements](files/rusya-proje.png) | In this project, the effect of in situ grown Si3N4  passivation on electrical, optical and structural properties of 2DEG including AlGaN/GaN structures were investigated in details. For the characterization, Hall effect, quantum Hall effect, high-speed pulse high electric field measurements, Raman, atomic force microscopy, x-ray diffraction and photoluminescence measurements were taken and analyzed. In addition to these experimental methods, the effect of several impurities on electronic and optical properties of Si3N4  material was investigated with density functional theory. In addition, some transistor parameters of high power transistors with Si3N4 passivation with impurities were calculated with device simulations.
