Welcome,

Low-dimensional Materials and Devices Research Group (LRG) is a research group within the sub-department of Condensed Matter Physics, which is part of the Department of Physics at Gazi University.

Our research is primarily focused on developing the physics and technology behind high-tech semiconductor devices which are mostly transistors. As material groups, we are interested in GaN-based materials, ZnO-based materials, graphene and black phosphorus. 

We are capable to conduct both experimental and calculations studies. More information about our facilities can be found here.

### Our start-up company application is supported by TUBITAK! 

*Aug 17 2018, by S. B. Lisesivdin*

Our start-up company plan for building UV-VIS-NIR spectrometer is financially supported by TUBITAK! This year TUBITAK received 3323 entrepreneurial business ideas for the Phase 0. Then after, 1438 entrepreneurs from these applications received Phase I support. Of these entrepreneurs prepared by the related organizations in their technical and business development areas, 422 were accepted for panel evaluations in accordance with the application requirements. TUBİTAK conducted by the academicians, industrialists and investors of the panel evaluation of the results of the 146 entrepreneurs were eligible to pass Phase II (result). Our company is one of them! More news are coming soon.

### Aestimo v.1.2.0 is released!

*Nov 06 2017, by S. B. Lisesivdin*

Nearly one year passed and the new version (v.1.2.0) of Aestimo is ready! Thanks to Robert Steed and Hamza Hebal for their efforts to make Aestimo better. We hope that you enjoy.

Some new features of Aestimo:
* Quaternary alloys (type A_{x}B_{1-x}C_{y}D_{1-y})
* Added an improved model for modeling conduction band intersubband transitions
* Added a periodic boundary condition for the Electric field for modeling repeating structures.
* Small changes were made like to get Aestimo to work on python3.4, example files were renamed to be more pythonic etc …
* Code is moved to GitHub.

Aestimo has a DOI number: 

**R. Steed, H. Hebal, and S. B. Lisesivdin. (2017, November 6). sblisesivdin/aestimo: Version v.1.2 (Version v.1.2.0). Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1042657**

Version 1.2 can be downloaded from this [link](https://github.com/sblisesivdin/aestimo/releases/download/v.1.2.0/aestimo_v.1.2.0.zip). Aestimo is GPL licensed software. Any improvements, bug reports or feedback are welcome.
