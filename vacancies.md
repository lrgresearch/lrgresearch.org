## Possible study subjects (not limited to):

### The ab-initio calculations of formation energies, electronic and optical properties of some impurities Nitrogen-Vacancy sites in Diamond Crystals

We invite highly motivated candidates for a MSc/PhD position to do research in computational physics in the area of material design. Our research is aimed at increased understanding of the electronic structure of NV centers in diamond and has applications in the development of room temperature quantum devices. The work spans areas of mathematical physics, quantum mechanics, numerical methods, programming, and the use of Linux OS and analysis software in materials research.  PhD study will be more focused and detailed on the subject. MSc study will be the part of the main study.

**Appointment time:** Two years for MSc, Four years for PhD.

**Deadline:** Applications were  taken between  02-13 December and 17-26 June, last year. These date are changing every year. Applicants must control the website of Institute of Science frequently.

**Contact:** For Autumn and spring terms, please contact to Sefer Bora Lişesivdin for preliminary interview not after May 31st and Nov 30th, respectively. 

### The further development of 1-dimensional Schrödinger-Poisson Equation solver: AESTIMO

We invite highly motivated candidates for a MSc/PhD position to do research in computational physics in the area of code development. Our research is aimed for related calculations of semiconductor heterostructures with quantum well  especially structures with polarization induced 2-dimensional electron/hole gases.  The work spans areas of mathematical physics, quantum mechanics, numerical methods, programming, and the use of Linux OS, Python language (compulsary) and analysis software in materials research.  PhD study will be more focused and detailed on the subject.
