With this project, ZnO-based heterostructures were reported for the first time with the USCVD method. In addition, the USCVD method was developed with a remote plasma system and the USPECVD system was installed. Within the scope of the project, MgZnO/ZnO heterostructures were grown with both USCVD and USPECVD methods. For this purpose, ZnO, MgZnO and doped MgZnO growths were performed on soda-lime, SiO2/Si and wurtzite substrates. The grown ZnO and MgZnO structures were examined in detail as a result of both structural and optical characterizations. According to many experimental parameters obtained, ZnO crystals were successfully produced in the form of thin films. MgZnO crystals were found to have a very different growth behavior than ZnO crystals. The 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) behavior was observed in low temperatures in the heterostructure. Based on the experience gained with this project, it has been concluded that MgZnO growth has very complex chemistry and this growth behavior should be examined much more deeply within the scope of a new scientific project. With this in-depth analysis of this growth method, more successful and usable MgZnO/ZnO structures can be produced and it can be competed with AlGaN/GaN.
