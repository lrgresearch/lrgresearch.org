## About

Low-dimensional Materials and Devices Research Group is a part of the sub-department of Condensed Matter Physics, which is part of the Department of Physics at Gazi University.

Our research is primarily focused on developing the physics and technology behind high-tech semiconductor devices which are mostly transistors. As material groups, we are interested in GaN-based materials, ZnO-based materials, graphene and black phosphorus.

We are capable to conduct both experimental and calculations studies. More information about our facilities can be found [here](facilities.md).
