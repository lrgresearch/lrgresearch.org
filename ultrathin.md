In this project, ultra-thin barrier HEMTs will be designed for different configurations including polarization, voltage and temperature variations, with solving the high-performance self-consistent 1-dimensional Schr√∂dinger-Poisson equations. Band structure, carrier density, and strain distributions are calculated. After design and modelling, the best structures are grown with Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) method. After, the electrical properties (Hall), and structural properties (Atomic force microscopy, X-Ray Diffraction) of these grown structures are measured. Results are enlighthened us to better understand ultra-thin barrier HEMT structures and result to look forward for producing transistors without the short-channel effects.
